Overview ✍️

In this project we craeted a SBI-Loan-Status Ml-Flask App, This App simply check the loan status of a customer [Code] [Demo].
We write the Dockerfile to create the Docker Image of SBI-Loan-Status and push that local repository to central repository(Guthub), using Github Action we create docker image of SBI-Loan-Status and push on the docker hub repository [Code] [Demo] .
And using Helm chart we Launch pods on kubernetes of SBI-Loan-Status image. If any changes happen in Ml-Flask App Github Action Automatically trigger and create the new image of changes code with same name and different tag and push on dockerHub. In Helm chart just we updated image tag name in value.yaml file, kubernetes Launch new pods of new image and terminating the old pods without any downtime using rolling update strategy.

Goal 🎯

To achieve Automation 🤖 in Data Science Project.

Overview ✍️

This is a simple flask app that is check your loan status in State Bank Of India 🏦 . This model is trained over real State Bank Of India Data.

Motivation 💪

Motivation is so interesting behind the creation of this project, Actually In my village, one of my Best friends father say that last five days he goes SBI Bank only to know Bank give me a loan or not because there are something issues with the previous loan (he already clear the loan). That time suddenly in my mind comes to the idea of why we do not create such type of model that takes some parameter and based upon this parameter the model predicts the loan status. I know banks give loans or not it depends upon other factors but it gives at least a high-level idea.

Introduction 🙋‍♀️

. Loan-Prediction.

. Understanding the problem statement is the first and foremost step. This would help you give an intuition of what you will face ahead of time. Let us see the problem statement.

. Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan. Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.

The Classification problem
. It is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. In a classification problem, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variable(s). Classification can be of two types: \

. Binary Classification : In this classification we have to predict either of the two given classes. For example: classifying the gender as male or female, predicting the result as win or loss, etc. Multiclass Classification : Here we have to classify the data into three or more classes. For example: classifying a movie's genre as comedy, action or romantic, classify fruits as oranges, apples, or pears, etc. \

. Loan prediction is a very common real-life problem that each retail bank faces atleast once in its lifetime. If done correctly, it can save a lot of man hours at the end of a retail bank.

FEATURES PRESENT IN LOAN PREDICTION
. Loan_ID – The ID number generated by the bank which is giving loan.
. Gender – Whether the person taking loan is male or female.
. Married – Whether the person is married or unmarried.
. Dependents – Family members who stay with the person.
. Education – Educational qualification of the person taking loan.
. Self_Employed – Whether the person is self-employed or not.
. ApplicantIncome – The basic salary or income of the applicant per month.
. CoapplicantIncome – The basic income or family members.
. LoanAmount – The amount of loan for which loan is applied.
. Loan_Amount_Term – How much time does the loan applicant take to pay the loan.
. Credit_History – Whether the loan applicant has taken loan previously from same bank.
. Property_Area – This is about the area where the person stays ( Rural/Urban).
. Property_Area – This is about the area where the person stays ( Rural/Urban).
. LOAN_STATUS – Based on the mentioned features, the machine learning algorithm decides whether the person should be give loan or not.

Run Locally

Go to the project directory

  cd SBI-Loan-Status-SBI_Project-
Install dependencies

  pip install requirements.txt
Start the server

  flask run app.py

2.Created a docker image of SBI-Loan-Status App and also push on DockerHub repository.

🏦 SBI-Loan-Status-App-To-Docker-Image 🐋
Overview ✍️
In which we create a docker image of Ml-Flask App and push on Docker-Hub 🐋 Repository using Github 😺 Action. After some chages into Ml-Flask App Everytime we create an image with same name and Different Tag 🏷️ and push on Docker Hub .

Motivation 💪
To use my SBI-Loan-Status-App in very Simple way, Don't Download any Dependcies of Related Of This Project.

Demo
  docker pull shivansh90/sbi-loan-image:07
Step-To-Create-This Project 👣
Step:-(i)
IN Same Directory You write Your Dockerfile Where Your Project Is.Obesely You Write Your Dockerfile Outside Your Project. App Screenshot

Step-(ii)
Push that local Directory into Central Repository (Github)

Step-(iii)
After Push the code into Central Repository (Github) Go to the Action Tab.
